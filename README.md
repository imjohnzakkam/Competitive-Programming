# Competitive-Programming
> The aim of this repo is to help people to get to know CP better.
> CP is awesome .. you'll never regret it .

There is a lot from CP to explore .. so maybe a list of contents ?

## List of Contents 

* [Basics](#Basics)
* [Starting](#Starting)
* [Consistency](#Consistency)
* [Coding Competitions](#Coding_Competitons)

## Basics 
> Many people fear CP ! It's actually great fun.

First of all what is CP ?, Its all about thinking logically and coding your ideas. 
All you need is one good programming language to start with and lots of passion.
If you are just figuring out what CP is, dont be worried everybody will get the hang of it.
> Some of our favourite videos on youtube which give an good idea of Comp Sci are :
* [Rachit Jain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl86tYr7emg)
* [CS Dojo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mElVGah7Epg)
> Check out this course [CS50](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/) it will help you build up your interest. 

These videos help a lot..please do check them out !

## Starting 

> After taking up one programming language, you can watch youtube tutorials to get an in-depth view of that particular programming lanuage
Some recommended youtube videos are :
* [For begginers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CpG3oATGIs)
> One can also checkout these websites to get used to programming logic :
* [For begginers](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming)
* [Next level](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
> Some books to refer : 
* [Competitive Programmer’s Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)
* Programming Challenges Steven Skiena (Its uploaded on the repo)
> Online resources for study :
* [studytonight.com](https://www.studytonight.com/)
* [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
* [learnxinyminutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/)
* [Some books for proffesionals](https://goalkicker.com/)

* Free Udemy courses (selected) can be downloaded through a torrent [here](https://freecoursesite.com/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/)

* [See this cool repo for all programming related books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md) you can find most books related to programming here .
> Problem Sets :
* [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/)
> After that you can go practice real time as you already have enough experience on one of the programming languages.
* Some documentations you can go through : 
> [Awesome Competitive Programming](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/23054)
The paltforms on which you can practice coding are (suggested sequence) :
* [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com)
* [Codechef](https://codechef.com) 
* [Code Forces](https://codeforces.com)

Other platforms to practice : 
* [topcoder](https://topcoder.com)
* [hackerearth](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/)  etc..

You can practice on any platform you like ! Its all about exploring.

## Consistency 

> Consistency is the key here too, a lot of people fail at this stage. That is because they don't get to know how fun solving differnt problems is.  

Some good practices for maintaining consistency are : 
* Figuring out which platform interests you. 
* Exploring different Algorithms and Data Structures.
* A good website for data structures and algorithms visulaiztion is [this from university of san fransisco](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html)

Commitment, Determination are the keys to success so, keep coding!!!

## Coding_Competions 

> Once you have enough practice you can participate in Coding Competitons either online or offline
Coding competitons are held almost day in Coding Platforms such as :
* [Codechef](https://codechef.com)
* [Code Forces](https://codeforces.com) One suggestion would be in Codeforces you could try long challenges and then can jump to short challenges
* [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com)
* [topcoder](https://topcoder.com)
> There is also a website for the live and ongoing coding competions [clist.by](https://clist.by)
> Also check out the extension on firefox called [Coder's Calendar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/coder-s-calendar/?src=search)
Apart from these regular ones, there are other worldwide competitions such as : 
* [Google Kickstart](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart) There are many rounds for this. You can try starting here for global challenges
* [Google Hash Code](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode)
* [Google Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam) *THIS IS THE TOP CODING COMPETITION FOR GOOGLE* 
* [India's top Coding Contest](https://www.techgig.com/codegladiators) - CODE GLADIATORS
* [Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/)
* [codeAgon]()
* [ACM ICPC](https://icpc.baylor.edu/) This is also top level 

>One has to realize there is a difference between hackathon and a coding competion [read more](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-difference-between-boot-camp-hackathon-and-programming-competition) and
>a coding contest is all about participation. No one will get first prize in their first participation. All you've to have is patience and never stop trying.
